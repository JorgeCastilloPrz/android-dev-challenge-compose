## :scroll: Description
Countdown timer using Jetpack Compose ðŸš€ for the #AndroidDevChallenge [week 2](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/android-dev-challenge-2.html). Click on the counter to insert the time, then click the play icon.

Happy to have tested some of the beta01 animation APIs ðŸ™Œ.

Some interesting stuff to peek into:

* Have a look to the [CountdownArc](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/f7819685e7eaa28b1bc203b5ab7ab723932ba1f7/app/src/main/java/com/example/androiddevchallenge/CountdownArc.kt#L40) composable for an example of `animateFloatAsState` used for animating the arc sweep angle.
* [This line](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/f7819685e7eaa28b1bc203b5ab7ab723932ba1f7/app/src/main/java/com/example/androiddevchallenge/Countdown.kt#L54) on the `Countdown` composable for an example on how to animate color via `animateColorAsState`, so the inner circle changes color following the color of the sweep edge. To calculate the color for a given percent [I'm using `lerp`](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/f7819685e7eaa28b1bc203b5ab7ab723932ba1f7/app/src/main/java/com/example/androiddevchallenge/CountdownArc.kt#L50).
* [The method `startCounter`](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/f7819685e7eaa28b1bc203b5ab7ab723932ba1f7/app/src/main/java/com/example/androiddevchallenge/CountdownTimer.kt#L60) in the `CountDownTimer` composable is the one in charge of updating the timer state so it gets recomposed every second. It uses a `CoroutineScope` as a result of `rememberCoroutineScope` so it can trigger the job after user interaction (button click) and cancel the previous ongoing job to avoid leaks. The complete animation is driven by the remaining time in seconds.
